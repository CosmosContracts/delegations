### Why Juno

Hello Juno Team,  
Juno has been part of our journey since the very beginning. It was one of the first networks we validated on, and the lessons we learned from the Juno community have been foundational to our growth. We're here for the long run and committed to supporting Juno through every challenge and every success, just as we have from the start.

### About Us

We launched our validator operations in 2023, with Juno being one of the first chains that set us on the path forward. Today, we operate validators across 40+ Mainnet chains and 20+ Testnets, securing over $30 million in assets under management.  
Our team has been actively involved in the Juno ecosystem, including helping coordinate validator responses during critical network upgrades that required manual intervention. We're passionate about contributing beyond uptime by strengthening community coordination, resilience, and growth.  
We see Juno not just as a network we validate, but as a community we are proud to stand with.

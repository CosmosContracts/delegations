# -ZenLounge- Delegation Program Application

## Description

The Zen Lounge Juno Validator is a secure and sovereign bare metal validator that puts the community and the ecosystems' values at it's heart. Zenwarrior113 and Dragonmonk111 created this validator and have actively participated in the pivotal governance proposals since the early days. The validator is also one of the top validators on Coreum network. We look forward to upkeep a righteous governance structure for Juno Network through transparent and informative discussions and help the community make informed decisions.

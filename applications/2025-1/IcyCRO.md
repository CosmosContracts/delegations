# -IcyCRO- Delegation Program Application

## Description

IcyCRO, a rapidly expanding Cronos community project, has emerged as a leading validator and top-tier relayer across five prominent chains: Cronos POS, ATOM, OSMO, Stride, and JUNO. We have had a steady growth since the launch of Cronos in November 2021.  

We have also rescued over $2.2M of delegator funds from compromised wallets pro bono.

We have never been slashed, have excellent uptime and are one of the most respected projects in the whole Cosmos.

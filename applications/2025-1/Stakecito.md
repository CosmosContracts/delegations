# Stakecito Delegation Program Application

## Description

At Stakecito Labs, we've honed our craft as validators. Our reputation as the third-largest validator by delegation count within the Cosmos ecosystem speaks to our unwavering dedication and the trust placed in us by over 290,000 delegators worldwide.

Our validation services are not just about maintaining blockchain networks though, and we validate networks outside of Cosmos as well (NEAR, Aleph Zero, CELO etc.). 

Our core mission is centered on demystifying blockchain technology to ensure it's accessible for everyone, from newcomers to seasoned investors.

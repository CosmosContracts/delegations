# Kleomedes Delegation Program Application

Kleomedes is an enterprise grade validator that self-hosts validator nodes and other blockchain infrastructure from Naples, Italy. We have never been slashed on any network, ever.

Our team is comprised of five industry experts who have a collective 15 years of experience in the blockchain industry. We are also the creators of stake-hub.xyz, a delegation UI and monitoring website for blockchains.
